# MovieDB

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionality

This is a simple project which uses the OMDB API to help users search for movies.

Currently you can only search using the title. Doing so will bring up a set of cards that display the poster for all matching movies/TV series' (if available) along with their titles. If you hover over a card you will also be able to see the year the movie was released. 

Due to the free nature of the OMDB API the site is limited to 1000 requests per day.
